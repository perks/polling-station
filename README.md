vanilla-poll.js
=====

##Description

A standalone library for creating the scaffolding for interactive polls and questionaires.
Has support for saving and fetching from HTML5 localstorage as well as remote API endpoints

Written in 100% plain-jane vanilla JavaScript



## Version

0.1

## Installation

Include the library in your polling page as followed:

```html
<script src="vanilla-poll.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Set up the data for the poll

The poll-data object must be set with the following schema:

Property | Subpropertes | Description
:----| :----| :-----
**_question_** | | The prompt of the poll; the question being asked
**_choices_** | *title*, *count*, *percent* | An array of objects that represent the options avaliable for selection <br> <ul><li>*title*: The description of the selection</li><li>*count*: Number of votes on this current selection<li>*percent*: A numeric value between 0-100 that represents the ratio of this selection to the poll total</ul>
**total** |  | The total amount of votes made for all selections in the poll

### HTML hooks and template rendering

At the very least, a parent element is required to exist on the page. By default, vanilla-poll will look for an element with the id **#polling-widget**, otherwise it will search for the CSS selector id passed in with the `el` context attribute upon instantiation

From this there are two ways to proceed:

#### Static HTML

The following HTML schema is needed when writting static HTML elements to the page:

*   Element with CSS id **#polling-question** to display poll question
*   Container elements with CSS id **#poll-choices** and **#poll-results**
    as respective parents (this can be a `<div` or `<ul>`, etc)
*   Individual elements with CSS group **.poll-choice** and **.poll-result** respectively
    nested under their parent container element, along with a data attribute **data-id** which corresponds to the index # of the poll-data object

Note that there is not much flexibility in rendering the DOM, the default templating function will overwrite anything that does not conform to this standard.

To tweak this behaviour, simply modify `default_template_func` within the **PollingWidget** function declaration


#### Templating function

The polling widget will also accept a custom templating function that can be passed into the `template` context attribute. The template exists as nested underneath the parent `el` element and must follow the same schema as above. However there is more flexibility, as you can include additional HTML elements as well as more freedom with positioning and arrangement of elements

Here is an example using a Handlebars template:

```javascript
var myCustomTemplateFunc = Handlebars.compile(document.getElementById('poll-template').innerHTML);
var myPoll = new PollingWidget({
    url: "data.json",
    template: myCustomTemplateFunc
});

myPoll.init();
```



### Instantiate  and start the polling widget

The polling widget object is created with a *context* argument that provides instructions for how you want to set up the poll. Here is an example

```javascript
    var myPollingWidget = new PollingWidget({
        el: #idOfWidgetDiv, // this defaults to #polling-widget
        url: 'api/endpoint', // this defaults to ''
    });
```

You can also pass in a local poll-data object as well through the `poll` parameter, to use as a starting point of you have no url endpoint or data in localstorage. Make sure to set the `localStorage` flag  to persist this data:

```javascript
var local_poll_data = {
    "question": "Is this a model loaded from a url endpoint?",
    "choices": [{
        "title": "Yes",
        "count": 10,
        "percent": 0
        }, {
        "title": "No",
        "count": 20,
        "percent": 0
        }],
    "total": 0
}

var myPollingWidget = new PollingWidget({
    poll: local_poll_data,
    localStorage: true
});
```


Then, once instantiated, start polling with:
```javascript
    myPollingWidget.init();
```
Which will render the poll into the DOM and set up the event binding
